== Project: Circles
Circles is a personal address book that stores and organises your contacts and their contact information,
displaying them in a neat and organised fashion.

*Code Contributed*: [link:{repoURL}/collated/main/LimeFallacie.md[`Functional Code`]][link:{repoURL}/collated/test/LimeFallacie.md[`Test Code`]]

=== Enhancement Added: Sorting

==== External Behaviour

include::UserGuide.adoc[lines = 337..348]

==== Justification
As our target audience was University students, we felt the need to provide tools to organise the contacts list as one student can come across many
over the course of his studies. With the ability to organise contacts in an intuitive way, users would easily be able to locate contacts by scrolling through the list
rather than constantly using the `Find` command.

The command word `sort` is used to denote the sort, and the following word would decide how the list would be sorted.
As there are plenty of different ways to sort contacts, this implementation was chosen to allow modularity for the inclusion of more ways to sort the list in the future.

==== Implementation
