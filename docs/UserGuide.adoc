== About
What’s the first thing you think about when you hear the words _“command line interface (CLI)”_?
Do you think of environments like the picture below, and feel daunted by it?

_Figure 1: Command Line Interface_

Rest assured, Circles is here to help. +
Circles is a personal address book that stores and organises your contacts and their contact information,
displaying them in a neat and organised fashion. +

It’s only caveat is that you, the user, can only control it using a CLI. Circles helps you practise using a
CLI in a more comfortable environment, and gets you used to using a single string of words to execute your commands by
making the commands as intuitive as possible. +

So now that you know what Circles can do for you, let’s dive into how to use Circles.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to the link:#features[Features] section below for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

2. The following message will appear if the add was successful. (As shown in Figure 3) +
_E.g: New person added: John Doe Phone: 81234567
Email: johnd@gmail.com Address: Blk 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25, Tags: [owesMoney][friends]_

[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0) +
The parameters for add command can be in any order. +
Entering `n/NAME, p/PHONE’ or ‘p/PHONE, n/NAME` will work as well. +
The tag parameter (t/TAG) can be left empty if there are no tags for the person +
You cannot add the exact same person into the Circles.

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

1. Enter `edit INDEX p/NEW_NUMBER` and Circles will update John Doe’s phone number, while the other information remains unchanged. +
_E.g: In Figure 5, the INDEX of John Doe is 6, so you enter_ `edit 6 p/98765432`
2. The following message will appear if the edit was successful. (As shown in Figure 5) +
_E.g: Edited Person: John Doe Phone: 98765432 Email: johnd@gmail.com Address: Blk 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 Tags: [owesMoney][friends]_

To search for his contact, simply do the following: +

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

1. Enter `find Yeoh` in the input field. Circles will filter out contact cards with text matching “Yeoh”.
2. Contact cards with relevant matching text will be displayed (As shown in Figure 6)

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
****

* `find John` +
Returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find Betsy Tim John` +

=== Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletion of contact can be in 2 formats, depending on how many contacts you are deleting. +

[.underline]#For single deletion# +
Format: `delete INDEX` +

1. Enter `list` to view the index of the specific contact

and look up the contact’s name on google browser. +
Format: `select INDEX` +

1. Enter `select` followed by the index number of the person you wish to select. +
_E.g._ `select 1`

=== Listing entered commands : `history`
If you want to retrieve a certain action you did previously or to simply view the past commands executed in
address book, Circles has a function to allow you to do so with just 1 command. +
Format: `history` +

1. Enter `history`.
2. A list of previously entered commands will be generated as shown in Figure 10.

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Unlike conventional address books that require you to manually delete / edit your mistakes while using the programme,
Circles allows you to undo the previous command. +

For example, you have accidentally deleted an important contact card and would want to retrieve it back. +
Format: `undo` +

1. Enter `undo` to undo a previously entered command
2. Contact card will be restored as shown in Figure 11.


[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
_Do note that this function does not work  for Select, Find, List, Sort, Exit commands._
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`
Now that you’ve retrieved a contact from the undo command, you realised that it was an incorrect contact
card that you wanted to retrieve and would like to delete it again. Circles can help you to save the trouble by
executing the `redo` function. +
Format: `redo` +

1. Enter `redo` to redo a previously undone command
2. Contact card will be deleted as shown in Figure 12.

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Sorting your contacts : `sort`
The first step to organizing your address book to make it search-friendly is to have your contacts sorted alphabetically.
Circles can do the job for you as well! +
Format: `sort` +

1. Enter `sort name` to sort contacts by name in alphabetical order.
2. Circles will now have your contacts sorted by name and displayed as shown in Figure 13.

[TIP]
You can sort the address book by phone and email too! Just enter `sort phone` or
`sort email` to sort address book by phone and email respectively

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`
When changing device used for Circles or to start a new address book, you might want to delete all contacts due to
privacy concerns. Instead of manually deleting contacts using the `delete` command,
Circles have a function to allow you to clear the whole address book. +

Format: `clear` +

1. Enter `clear` to clear all contacts.
2. Address book will now be empty as shown in Figure 14.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

simply enter `exit`, or go to `File > Exit` from the menu bar to exit the program. +
