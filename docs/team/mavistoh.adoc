== Project: Cricles
Circles is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B3/main/blob/master/collated/main/mavistoh.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B3/main/blob/master/collated/test/mavistoh.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Delete Multiple

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Multiple deletion is implemented as an enhancement from the current `delete` function. This
is to aid users to delete more than 1 contact within 1 command. Functions implemented previously
only allow users to either delete single contact or the whole list.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Optional Fields while Adding

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=optional]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may not have the full set of details for a particular contact and the previous `add` mechanism may deny users to
add these contacts into Circles.

==== Implementation

---

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=optional]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Birthday field

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=optional]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The addition of this field provides user with more comprehensive contact details to
add into Circles.

==== Implementation

---

The UI has to be edited to include a placeholder for the field in `PersonInfoPanel.fxml`:

[source,java]
----
<Label fx:id="birthday" styleClass="label-bright" GridPane.columnIndex="1" GridPane.rowIndex="2" />

----
To implement `birthday` field, the parameter is added into the Person class as shown below in the model diagram. This is
 implemented as `Birthday.c` +

image::ModelClassDiagramupdated.png[width="800"]
_Figure 3 : Structure of the Model Component_ +

[source,java]
----
public Birthday(String birthday) throws IllegalValueException {
        if (birthday == null) {
            this.value = BIRTHDAY_EMPTY;
        } else {
            String trimmedBirthday = birthday.trim();
            if (!isValidBirthday(trimmedBirthday)) {
                throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_BIRTHDAY_CONSTRAINTS);
            }
            this.value = trimmedBirthday;
        }
    }

----

As shown in the model diagram, `ReadOnlyPerson` will have to be modified to support the `birthday` field:
[source,java]
----
ObjectProperty<Birthday> birthdayProperty();
    Birthday getBirthday();
----

In the storage aspect, new field will need to be added in the `XMLAdaptedPerson` class so that
the data will be saved even when Circles is closed:
[source,java]
----
public XmlAdaptedPerson(ReadOnlyPerson source) {
            name = source.getName().fullName;
            phone = source.getPhone().value;
            birthday = source.getBirthday().value;
            email = source.getEmail().value;
            ...
            }
----

---

=== Enhancement Proposed
==== Link Social Networking Sites
A new field called `URL` can be implemented as a parameter for input of contact details so that
users can store contact's social media sites from Circles. +

Implementation will be similar to the `birthday` field and link it to `BrowserPanel` class in UI to get the usernames
as suffix for the social media platform URL.

==== Change of Theme Colours
Similar to the implementation of the `birthday` field, a command called `Mode` can be executed to change
theme of Circles. +

When executing `Mode`, user can change theme colours, i.e: Dark Theme, Light Theme, Black-White Theme etc. . This
enhancement to link to UI aspect of Circles. Currently there is only one theme which is `DarkTheme.css`. Variations can
be made from `/resources/view` and link to `Mode` Command.

=== Other contributions

* Implemented `Find Address` function for V1.1 version of Circles. This function
 finds contact with keyword matching contact's address. (Pull request https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T17-B3/main/pull/12[#12]) +
 This was subsequently improved into `Find [KEYWORD]` function which matches keyword to all fields
from the contact card.
